### Hosting a Meetup versus a Cloud Native Community Day

Hosting meetups can be as simple as 1-2 hours of content + networking no matter what style you decide (speaker to audience, study groups, lightning talks, etc.).

Hosting a Cloud Native Community Day is a great way to practice for a KCD. A Cloud Native Community Day can be like a large meetup where:
* You have a one half (1/2) of a day of content - so 4 hours of multiple speakers.
* You acquire sponsorships.
* You provide breaks with beverages and/or food.
* Your event is still free to attend like a meetup, but perhaps you create qualification standards in case your capacity is limited.
* You still host it on [community.cncf.io](https://community.cncf.io/) so CNCF can see you have had practice at an event larger than a meetup, and CNCF can gauge if your community is ready for a KCD based on attendance.
* These can be hosted as often as you would like with a reccomendation being no more than once per quarter.
* There is no limit to the number of attendees.
* NOTE: Hosting a Cloud Native Community Day is not a requirement for hosting a KCD.

How does a Cloud Native Community Day differ from a KCD?
* The KCDs are supported by CNCF with more benefits/perks, and go through an official application and planning process.
* These are 1 to 2 day events like a summit, and often times can host multiple tracks and keynotes.
* KCDs can charge a fee for their tickets.
* KCDs get an accreditation from CNCF for hosting an event.
* There are requirements to assure CNCF quality standards.
* KCD have a limite of 500 attendees.
* KCDs in the same city (and sometimes small country) can only be hosted once per year.
