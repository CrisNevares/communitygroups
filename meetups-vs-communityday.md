### Hosting a Meetup versus a Cloud Native Community Day

Hosting meetups can be as simple as 1-2 hours of content + networking no matter what style you decide (speaker to audience, study groups, lightning talks, etc.).

Hosting a Cloud Native Community Day is a great way to practice for a KCD. A Cloud Native Community Day can be like a large meetup where:
* You have a one half (1/2) of a day of content - so 4 hours of multiple speakers.
* You acquire sponsorships.
* You provide breaks with beverages and/or food.
* Your event is still free to attend like a meetup, but perhaps you create qualification standards in case your capacity is limited.
* You still host it on [community.cncf.io](https://community.cncf.io/) so CNCF can see you have had practice at an event larger than a meetup, and CNCF can gauge if your community is ready for a KCD based on attendance.
* These can be hosted as often as you would like with a reccomendation being no more than once per quarter.
* NOTE: Hosting a Cloud Native Community Day is not a requirement for hosting a KCD.

### Is Cloud Native Day in my city a part of the program?

If the event is not named exactly "Cloud Native Community Day", most likely it is not.

Events like "Cloud Native {CITY_NAME}",  "Cloud Native Day {CITY_NAME}", "Kubehuddle {CITI_NAME}" are independent from the CNCF,
even if they might be organized by CNCF Ambassadors or member companies.
CNCF does not govern those events, and the formats are managed by the respective organizers of the events.
