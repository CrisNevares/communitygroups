# Logos

Cloud Native Community Group logos can be found via [the CNCF logo repository](https://github.com/cncf/artwork/blob/master/examples/other.md#cloud-native-community-groups)
* simply add "Cloud Native [YOUR CHAPTER NAME]" underneath it

NOTE: For naming conventions, please use "Cloud Native CITY NAME" for your social media pages and other promotions. You may use a tagline that states your group is an official CNCF chapter.

IMPORTANT: Cloud Native Community Groups are no longer permitted to create their own logos. This will also alleviate organizers having to hire design services. It also creates unity across all community groups supported by CNCF, and brand awareness for when organizers try to secure sponsorships.

# Promotional Graphics

# Recognition Help

Some chapters have stated it would be helpful to approach companies who do not know who CNCF is, with a presentation that explains who CNCF is. Well, look no further than [the main CNCF repostitory of presentations where there is an overview slide deck in multiple languages.](https://github.com/cncf/presentations/blob/main/README.md#cncf-overview-presentation)

CNCF is also happy to write letters of reccomendation for those who need help securing a venue, or simply need recognition of an official CNCF chapter. Just reach out to community-groups@cncf.io with your request.
