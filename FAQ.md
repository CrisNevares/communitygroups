## **FAQ - About Bevy**

### **What is Bevy?**

Bevy is a scalable community events platform, powering the communities of[Figma](http://friends.figma.com),[Slack](http://slackcommunity.com), [GoDaddy](https://proevents.godaddy.com/),[Twitch](http://meetups.twitch.tv), [Miro](https://events.miro.com/), [Asana](https://events.asana.com/), [Salesforce](https://trailblazercommunitygroups.com/) and many others. It already powers our Cloud Native Community Groups ([https://community.cncf.io](https://community.cncf.io)) and is the platform that our Kubernetes Community Days runs on.

### **What are the benefits of using Bevy?**

Bevy will centralize all cloud native groups, across the globe –– making it easier for community members to find and access local events like meetups, conferences, workshops, etc., into one cloud native events hub; offer a better experience for group organizers when announcing events and communicating with group members; provide better insights into the global cloud native community analytics and data to allow us to provide the best possible support to our communities and yourselves as organizers.

## **FAQ - Switching from Meetup to Bevy**

### **Why did CNCF switch over from Meetup to Bevy?**

We made the switch to Bevy in 2020 because we heard your concerns. Meetup was not the best tool to build community, especially an online community. It was not easy to communicate with community members, run online events, and it was hard to keep group members active and engaged, or to gauge who was an active member. The ability to collect data was limited and ultimately, it felt like a very disjointed experience from CNCF itself.

### **When do I need to switch over from Meetup to Bevy?**

CNCF stopped supporting groups on Meetup on <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Friday, December 31st, 2021</span>. While you can still use meetup.com as a marketing engine, registration must be turned off (or set to a capacity of 0 or 1), and point to community.cncf.io for registration. Please note, this will create duplicate efforts, as Bevy is no longer integrated with meetup.com.

### **What will happen to my group on Meetup after the switch to Bevy?**

CNCF previously paid for Pro membership for almost 200 groups on Meetup. CNCF stopped paying for this membership and ended our contract at the end of 2021. Some of you may have spent years building your groups on Meetup but since we know only about 20-30% of group members are active in any group, it would be a confusing and unfair experience for community members to have to seek out information about your group on Meetup and Bevy. To make things easier for everyone involved, we decided to close down the groups we had been paying for. Additionally, when we stopped paying for the groups there was a short window in which someone else could step up and take financial responsibility for keeping the group open, but that is not a cost we felt anyone of our leaders or community members should shoulder. We have invested a lot of analysis, time, and money into moving our events community onto Bevy and we are confident it will be a much better experience for leaders on group management and members on event attendance.

### **Will all my group members switch over from Meetup to Bevy?**

No. Only ~20% of your group members are probably active and so we’d imagine only the most active group members from Meetup will actually make an account and join your Bevy group. This means you will have the most accurate number of group members in your groups on Bevy and can build a truly cohesive and engaged group.

### **How was this change communicated to group members?**

In November 2021, we sent an email and Meetup message to the group members letting them know about this upcoming change.

### **When will my group page be ready?**

Most of the existing Meetup groups have already been migrated to the new platform. If you are an owner of the Meetup group that already exists on the CNCG platform or you want to bootstrap a new group on Bevy, please apply by [filing a GitHub issue here](https://github.com/cncf/communitygroups/issues/new?template=new-group-request.yaml). Meetup has a function that allows for you to download your members if they were attendees of an event. You must have a Pro Account to be able to do this. Once done, please reach out to community-groups@cncf.io to request your members to be uploaded to your Bevy chapter.

### **I am an organizer of the Meetup group, and my group was migrated on Bevy. However I don't have the organizers permissions. Why?**

The Meetup groups have been migrated, but organizers were not (it’s not technically possible, unfortumatelty). We'll encourage you to apply for running this chapter via the GitHub issue linked above.

### **Why can’t you simply create an account for everyone from Meetup to Bevy?**

Because Bevy is a separate platform from Meetup, we are not legally able to set up a new account for all your current Meetup members, especially keeping GDPR regulations and privacy laws in mind. Keeping our users' privacy and consent intact is very important to us. Thank you for understanding.

## **FAQ - General**

### **Will the pricing policy change?**

CNCF will cover all costs for the hosted community platform.

### **How does the social coverage/network of Bevy compare to Meetup.com?**

The events on a new platform will benefit from the CNCF Marketing team's power and coverage. Compared to the Meetup.com-hosted events, the new platform allows hosting the events under the cncf.io domain and embedding more deeply into the marketing tools and technologies currently used by CNCF for the networking outreach. Furthermore, CNCF is committed to marketing meetups and events across our platforms.

How often are the Cloud Native Community Groups applications reviewed?

We review the CNCG applications weekly, and if your submission satisfies our requirements and best practices, we'll send you an invitation.

### **Do I need to re-apply?**

No, once you formally apply, you are a part of the pool of applicants.

### **Does CNCF offer promotional support for the Community Groups?**

CNCF is happy to offer marketing support for the Community Groups in some exceptional cases.

Also, please make sure that you are aware of other community-focused CNCF programs, including [CNCF Ambassadors](https://www.cncf.io/people/ambassadors/).

### **I'd like to get in touch with the CNCF ambassador in a specific city/region. Where can I find who a local ambassador is?**

Here is a [map of the CNCF Ambassadors](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fb0UPi8ijeexueBxcpGuvVlZ_8hJHXVQ&usp=sharing).

### **I have a question that was not answered in the FAQ -- how can I get in touch?**

Please post questions in the #communitygroups channel in Slack (preferred) or email [meetups@cncf.io](mailto:meetups@cncf.io)
