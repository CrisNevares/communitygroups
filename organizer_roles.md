# ORGANIZERS

In order to remain a strong and active community, we believe CNCGs are successful with 2 or more organizers with responsibilities
divided among each other. Ideally there is no more than 5 organizers for virtual chapters, and no more than 7 for in-person. Please refer to the roles below.

IMPORTANT: Cloud Native Community Groups are NOT to be used for self benefit. In an effort to avoid monopilzation practices, organizers cannot belong to more than two (2) community groups as an organizer. You may of course help advise other groups, but will not be recognized as an organizer on the front-end of said chapter page if you do not reside in, or travel to that chapter location 50% of the calendar year.

You are already donating your time to further the knowledge and awareness of Cloud Native technologies, likely in addition to a full-time job. In addition, people may fall ill, get injured, or have new deadlines. With that, it will benefit you to have backup to avoid cancellations of your meetups.

### All organizers are leaders
Thank you in advance for not assuming lead organizer roles, as Bevy can be confusing with the permission sets.

### Assignments
We do however, suggest your team figure out who has more experience organizing different facets of community groups like:
* Sponsorships
* Speakers
* F&B (Food and Beverage)
* A/V (Audio & Video)
* Swag
* On-site emcee
* Attendee marketing and communications

NOTE: If your team is small, it is common to have 1-2 assignments per person.

### Team additions

If you wish to add someone or multiple people to your team, you may submit [an organizer GitHub issue/request](https://github.com/cncf/communitygroups/issues) on behalf of these co-organizers and have that person (or people) comment on the issue agreeing the the organizer terms. Or this peron / these people can submit on behalf of themselves and at least 50% of organizers shall comment with affirmation of said person being added as a co-organizer.

### Team resignation

If someone on your team wishes, or agrees to step down as an organizer, please have them [submit a GitHub issue](https://github.com/cncf/communitygroups/issues) via the organizer request form here. You may [submit an issue](https://github.com/cncf/communitygroups/issues) on their behalf, but that team member will still need to comment affirming their resignation. This is to assure communication among the team, and transparency to the rest of your local community.
