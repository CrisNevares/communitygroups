# ORGANIZERS

In order to remain a strong and active commnity, we believe community groups are successfull with 3 or more organizers with responsibilities
divided among eachother.
You are already donating your time to further the knoweldge and awareness of Cloud Native technologies, likely in addition to a full-time job.
And things happen, meaning people fall sick, get injured, or have new deadlines. With that, it will benefit you to have backup to avoid cancelations
of your meetups.

### All organizers are leaders
Thank you in advance for not assuming lead organizer roles, as Bevy can be confusing with the permission sets.

### Assignments
We do however, suggest your team figure out who has more experience organizing different facets of community groups like:
* Sponsorships
* Speakers
* F&B (Food and Beverage)
* A/V (Audio & Video)
* Swag
* On-site emcee
* Attendee marketing and communications

NOTE: Your team  might be small, so is is common to have 1-2 assignments per person.
