# ORGANIZERS

In order to remain a strong and active community, we believe CNCGs are successful with 2 or more organizers with responsibilities
divided among each other. Ideally there is no more than 5 organizers for virtual chapters, and no more than 7 for in-person. Please refer to the roles below.

You are already donating your time to further the knowledge and awareness of Cloud Native technologies, likely in addition to a full-time job. In addition, people may fall ill, get injured, or have new deadlines. With that, it will benefit you to have backup to avoid cancellations of your meetups.

### All organizers are leaders
Thank you in advance for not assuming lead organizer roles, as Bevy can be confusing with the permission sets.

### Assignments
We do however, suggest your team figure out who has more experience organizing different facets of community groups like:
* Sponsorships
* Speakers
* F&B (Food and Beverage)
* A/V (Audio & Video)
* Swag
* On-site emcee
* Attendee marketing and communications

NOTE: If your team is small, it is common to have 1-2 assignments per person.

### Team resignation

If someone on your team wishes, or agrees to step down as an organizer, please have them write to community-groups@cncf.io with their resignation, and one of the core CNCF team members will remove them from the chapter.
