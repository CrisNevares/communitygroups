Cloud Native Community Group logos can be found via [the CNCF logo repository](https://github.com/cncf/artwork/blob/master/examples/other.md#cloud-native-community-groups)
* simply add your city name underneath it

NOTE: For naming conventions, please use "Cloud Native CITY NAME" for your social media pages and other promotions. You may use a tagline that statest your groups is an official CNCF chapter.

IMPORTANT: Cloud Native Community Groups are no longer permitted to create their own logos. This will also alleviate organizers having to hire design services, and create unity accross all community groups supported by CNCF.
